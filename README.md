## Description:

This is a WIP, at the moment it scrapes character names and ratings into a JSON object, the data is scraped from here: https://gbf.wiki/Character_Tier_List/Gamewith/Ratings -- A big thanks to the wiki contributers for keeping great up to date data.

## Installation Instructions:

This requires express.js, node.js, cheerio, nodemon and axios. Open the terminal and begin with ```npm init``` followed by ```npm i``` to hopefully automatically install all required dependencies.

Run the program by opening your terminal in the main folder and typing ```npm start``` which requires nodemon (you should probably globally install it)

## Usage:

To create a JSON object of granblue characters and their associated rating. Will eventually be turned into an API for discord bot to query.
